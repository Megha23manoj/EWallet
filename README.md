## E-WALLET PAYMENT SYSTEM

###  Introduction
Traditional brick-and-mortar banking offers customers a personal dimension. Customers
visit the bank, converse with the financial advisors or representatives who can help them
manage their accounts, and get answers to their queries. While this can be more
reassuring to many customers, online banking has its own benefits that traditional banks
cannot provide. These drawbacks are addressed and implemented via the employed
E-Payment Systems.
The Wallet E-Payment System is a standard electronic or online payment system that
meets users' expectations for convenience in payment transactions from anywhere and
at any time. Online payments are likely to be vulnerable to fraudulent activities and
technical disturbances. It can be challenging to provide optimal infrastructure and
services for processing these payments. The primary objective of deploying this system
is to provide users and service providers with a safe and convenient platform to make
payments online, ensuring financial security. This way, time and cost-effectiveness are
also guaranteed, which in turn activates more users to utilize it. The collaboration with
existing payment systems like service providers and bank applications (which serve as a
source of funds) allows for a seamless experience for users.

### Implementation
Create a Wallet database to store User information and to track their transaction in a
Wallet application system, ensuring user convenience without any mobility. Wallet
Database is cosidered to be a payment network comprising of User information, user
accounts, bank account information and transactions and statements. Each customer
using the Wallet application is uniquely identified by their SSN. Each user with the Bank
account linked to the Wallet application is recognized by the BankID and Bank Account
Number. The application supports two types of actions, i.e., Send Transaction and
Request Money Transaction each of which are identified uniquely by their Send
Transaction ID and Request Transaction ID respectively. To expand on the basis of how
and through which data the transactions are being processed, is by using their Identifer
fields which can be either their phone number or email address. Extra information is
stored in a additional information to ensure the alternative way to address actions if the
primary information fails.
